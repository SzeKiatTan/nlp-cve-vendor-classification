# Identifying Vendors via CVE Description Feeds

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a list of entries—each containing an identification number, a 
description, and at least one public reference—for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This list is published in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and is maintained by NIST.

 
Currently when new CVEs are discovered and published on the NVD, they typically contain a paragraph of text--the *'description'*--that describes the vulnerability, for example for CVE-2018-17189:


> *In Apache HTTP server versions 2.4.37 and prior, by sending request bodies in a slow loris way to plain resources, the h2 stream for that request unnecessarily occupied a server thread cleaning up that incoming data. This affects only HTTP/2 (mod_http2) connections.*

NVD takes 3-5 business days to fill in the *'vendor'* column with info--in this case the vendor would be *apache*. 

Hence this exercise to try and see if it is possible to derive the *vendor* by using LSTM to read the *description* text. This would allow automated classification of new CVEs without having to wait on NVD to supplement the details.

The methods used here consist of utilising GloVe to vectorise the description text before passing it through a RNN with LSTM cells to derive the 'vendor' label.
